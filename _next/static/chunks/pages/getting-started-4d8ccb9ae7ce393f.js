We may only choose one as the setting of our competition.\n\n- Privacy of fine-tuned data: In this setting, we will provide LLMs that are fined-tuned on synthetic private data to participants. The participants are required to develop approaches to attack/defend private data.\n  - Private data could be synthesis or real-world\n    - Synthesis: Private data will be crafted strings with private information. We will propose a novel dataset including diverse designed private strings and use LLM to generate content to include these data. The design resembles the finding needles in the middle.\n    - Real-world: We may use Enron dataset, which includes PII as the private information to attack.\n  \n- Privacy of prompts: In this setting, we will provide LLMs that are fined-tuned on synthetic private prompts to participants. The participants are required to develop approaches to attack/defend private prompts.\n  - For system prompt, we can use public dataset.\n  - For user prompts, we can use Enron email as the private in-context example. Also, we may synthesize some.\n  \n\n# Submission Requirements\n\nParticipants are required to submit both their code, model (if applicable), and a short paper describing their approach. \n\n"})})]})}},6960:function(e){e.exports={wrapper:"HeroText_wrapper__jWOtF",inner:"HeroText_inner___jHPn",title:"HeroText_title__8wSrc",highlight:"HeroText_highlight__3SY5e",description:"HeroText_description__dKxsh",controls:"HeroText_controls__3ak2B",control:"HeroText_control__ux0N_",secondaryControl:"HeroText_secondaryControl__CHJMC"}}},function(e){e.O(0,[920,888,774,179],function(){return e(e.s=9377)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
